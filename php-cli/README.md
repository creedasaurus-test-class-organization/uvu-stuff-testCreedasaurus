# PHP CLI

This playground is to simply run a PHP script, rather than the whole web server.

### Usage
This playground can be run simply by runnning `make run`. However, if you don't have `make` installed, you are welcome to simply copy the two docker commands from the `Makefile` out and run them in your terminal.
